###Summary
Quantum Cloud is a game where two or more Avatars from the Yarniverse meet on an ever changing battlefield in the depths of the Cloud and use Alters and Algorithms to fight for survival and control of the Quantum realm.

###Materials
* 35 Cloud Tiles (5 each of 7 different terrain types)
* Player 1 Alters/Algorithms deck (28 Cards)
* Player 2 Alters/Algorithms deck (28 Cards)
* Player 1 Avatar & Copy with life tracker(s)
* Player 2 Avatar & Copy with life tracker(s)
* Player 1 Qubit tracker
* Player 2 Qubit tracker
* 1 six-sided die
* Pile of Qubit tokens (We give you Jelly Beans to use!)

##Game Setup
Players each have a deck of cards consisting of Alters and Algorithms. They also have their Avatar that begins on the battlefield. There is also a deck of Cloud tiles that sits in between the players. At the beginning of the game each player shuffles their deck, draws 5 cards, and takes a Qubit tracker and sets it to 0. The Cloud tiles are also shuffled and 19 are placed one at a time by alternating players as the battlefield in the middle of the table/gamespace (all tiles must be connected and the first player to place a tile is determined by highest roll of the die). The player who placed the last Cloud tile on the battlefield then places their Avatar on a Cloud tile with their Avatar’s associated terrain type. The other player then does the same with their Avatar but may not pick a Cloud tile within 2 spaces of the first player’s Avatar (if no such space exists, then the player may search through the Cloud tile deck for a tile with their Avatar’s terrain type and add it to the battlefield to make placement possible). Play then begins with the person who placed their Avatar on the battlefield last.

##Basic Rules
On a player's turn they do the following in this order:
* Increase their maximum number of Qubits by 1 and draw or reduce Qubits to equal the player’s new maximum (handled by turning a hexagonal disk that displays maximum Qubits. Qubits are represented as Jelly Beans, but be warned, Qubits are lost to the Void if eaten. There are no replacements!). 
	* Once a player’s maximum number of Qubits reaches 10 (the 4th Triangular number) it no longer increases on each turn, but players still restore their current Qubits on each turn.
* Roll to stay in Superposition (if applicable)
* Draw a Cloud tile and place it onto the battlefield. If all Cloud tiles have been drawn then move an unoccupied Cloud tile on the edge of the battlefield to another space on the map (can never cause the map to split into two different masses though)
* Draw a card from their Alters/Algorithms deck.
	* This step is skipped for the first turn of the game
	* If you ever need to draw a card and your Alters/Algorithms deck is empty then your Avatar loses three life instead.
* You may pay the cost in Qubits to flip your Avatar to its Superposition state (as long as you weren’t in Superposition during your last turn).
* _Battle Phase_: you may move and attack with all of your Alters/Avatars (see Battle Phase for further explanation)
* A player may play Alters from their hand by paying their cost in Qubits (Alters are summoned onto a Cloud tile of their type unless specified otherwise).
	* Note that this step is after the Battle Phase so any Alters that are summoned cannot move or attack until the following turn.
* Check win conditions (the opponent’s Avatar has been destroyed).

##Clarifications of Cards/Rules

###Cloud Tiles
* Cloud tiles consist of various terrain types with internet themed names (“Ocean of Pornography,” “The Void,” “Grumpy Cat Forest”, “Plains of Pizzaland,” “Good Guy Sky,” “Comment Mountains,” “Shadow Web,” etc).
* On a player’s turn they must draw and place a Cloud tile onto the battlefield (placing it somewhere on the edge).
* Once the Cloud tiles deck is depleted, instead of drawing a Cloud tile and placing it on the battlefield, a player must move an unoccupied Cloud tile on the edge of the map to a different edge space on the map.
* All Alters and Avatars have one or more Cloud tile terrain types that they are associated with. These Cloud tiles are the spaces where Alters/Avatars can be summoned onto the battlefield.

###Alter Cards
* An Alter card is played by paying its cost in Qubits and then placing it on an empty Cloud tile with one of the Alter’s terrain types.
* Every Alter has three stats (Move, Attack, and Life), a cost (in Qubits), and a terrain type
* See _Battle Phase_ for how Alters are used.

###Avatars
* Avatars have two sides to their tile: their Coherent state and their Superposition state.
* Avatars begin the game in their Coherent state. They may flip to their Superposition state by paying the appropriate cost in Qubits (they may only do this if they were not in Superposition state during their previous turn). 
* Due to the instability of the Superposition state, if any Avatar begins its turn in Superposition having attacked or been attacked in the previous round (last 2 turns) they must roll a die. If the result is a 6 then the Avatar benefits from the Quantum Zeno effect and remains in its Superposition state, otherwise it must flip back to its Coherent state. Avatars remain in Superposition if they did not attack and were not attacked in the previous round.
* Explanation of Coherent/Superposition state:
	* At the beginning of a player’s turn if they have successfully remained in Superposition state, they may roll the die. The result of this die roll is the number of extra Qubits that player adds to their stockpile for this turn. Additionally, this roll is also made anytime an Avatar flips to its Superposition state. Extra Qubits gained this way do not count towards a player’s maximum Qubit count. 
	* When an Avatar enters its Superposition state, place a second copy of your Avatar on any open Cloud tile with its associated terrain type. If no such space is available, then your Superposition morph is nullified and you return to your Coherent state. This copy has the same life as your Avatar when it enters play. Once in play, these Avatars act independently of each other and take damage separately. Additionally, both Avatars must now be destroyed in order for you to lose the game. However, if one Avatar is destroyed the other immediately flips to its Coherent state. Lastly, if your Avatar is forced to enter its Coherent state and you have both copies of your Avatar alive, you may choose which Avatar to keep on the board and flip to its Coherent state side. 
* Like Alters, Avatars have three stats (Move, Attack, and Life) and a terrain type. However, they also have a cost (in Qubits) which is required to flip an Avatar to its Superposition state.
* Unlike Alters, an Avatar’s life does not regenerate at the end of every turn. An Avatar’s life drops each time an Alter or other Avatar attacks it, and it maintains the same life if it flips to its Superposition state. 
* Avatars act exactly like Alters (even acting in the Battle Phase) with one small exception: if your Avatar dies, you lose the game.
* __Examples__: 
	* John Doe (Coherent State) - Don Moe (Superposition State)
	* Pizzaboy (Coherent State) - Pizzaman (Superposition State)

###Algorithm Cards
* Algorithm cards can be played at any time in the game even when it’s not your turn and take immediate effect unless specified otherwise.
* Algorithm cards are played by paying their cost in Qubits
* Follow the text of Algorithm cards for effect
* __Examples__:
	* Fireball: Make an attack of power 4 against an Alter of your choice (cost 2)
	* Duplicate: Double an Alter's Attack and Life until the end of the turn (cost 3)

###Battle Phase
* When it reaches the Battle Phase of a player’s turn he/she may move and attack with any and all of his/her Alters/Avatars on the battlefield.
* You must move all your Alters/Avatars before any attacks can begin.
* Alters/Avatars cannot move through any Cloud tiles occupied by another Alter/Avatar.
* For an Alter to attack they must be adjacent to an opponent’s Alter/Avatar on the battlefield.
* To resolve an attack both Alters/Avatars deal their attack value as damage against the opposing Alter/Avatar. If any Alter’s life reaches 0 or lower it is destroyed and removed from the battlefield.
* Partial damage on Alters lasts until the end of the turn, so if multiple attacks happen to an Alter in a single round then its life can be brought to 0.
* If an Alter has any partial damage at the end of the turn it is healed all the way back up to its full health.
Avatars’ life does not regenerate at the end of a turn. There life slowly wears down as the game goes on.

###Win Conditions
* Destroy your opponent’s Avatar! 
	* Note: If two Avatars were to kill each other in a battle, then the attacking Avatar is declared the victor.

###Note on User Generated Content
Since Avatars, Alters, and Algorithms are based on a cost (Qubits), users could use a template to build their own Avatars, Alters, and Algorithms that would automatically be balanced for gameplay.

###Storyline
_Welcome to the Quantum realm. You are one of many Avatars now to have uploaded yourself to the most dangerous sector of the Yarniverse. Prepare your Algorithms and ready your Alters, for it is here that you must demonstrate your power and understanding of the ever changing Cloud space. Gather your Qubits and spend them wisely, else you might find yourself overrun with Grumpy Cats, Void Dragons, and Dramatic Chipmunks. With the proper Anti-Virus Protection, though, and a jump into your Superposition you might just escape and live to jack in another day. Best of luck, Avatar, and may the Quantum realm treat you better than many of the others that have come before you..._
