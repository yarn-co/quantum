#Quantum

###Summary
Quantum Cloud is a game where two or more Avatars from the Yarniverse meet on an ever changing battlefield in the depths of the Cloud and use Alters and Algorithms to fight for survival and control of the Quantum realm.

###Materials
- 35 Cloud Tiles (5 each of 7 different terrain types)
- Player 1 Alters/Algorithms deck (28 Cards)
- Player 2 Alters/Algorithms deck (28 Cards)
- Player 1 Avatar & Copy with life tracker(s)
- Player 2 Avatar & Copy with life tracker(s)
- Player 1 Qubit tracker
- Player 2 Qubit tracker
- 1 six-sided die
- Pile of Qubit tokens (We give you Jelly Beans to use!)

###Game Setup
Players each have a deck of cards consisting of Alters and Algorithms. They also have their Avatar that begins on the battlefield. There is also a deck of Cloud tiles that sits in between the players. At the beginning of the game each player shuffles their deck, draws 5 cards, and takes a Qubit tracker and sets it to 0. The Cloud tiles are also shuffled and 19 are placed one at a time by alternating players as the battlefield in the middle of the table/gamespace (all tiles must be connected and the first player to place a tile is determined by highest roll of the die). The player who placed the last Cloud tile on the battlefield then places their Avatar on a Cloud tile with their Avatar’s associated terrain type. The other player then does the same with their Avatar but may not pick a Cloud tile within 2 spaces of the first player’s Avatar (if no such space exists, then the player may search through the Cloud tile deck for a tile with their Avatar’s terrain type and add it to the battlefield to make placement possible). Play then begins with the person who placed their Avatar on the battlefield last.

###Basic Rules
On a player's turn they do the following in this order:
* Increase their maximum number of Qubits by 1 and draw or reduce Qubits to equal the player’s new maximum (handled by turning a hexagonal disk that displays maximum Qubits. Qubits are represented as Jelly Beans, but be warned, Qubits are lost to the Void if eaten. There are no replacements!). 
	* Once a player’s maximum number of Qubits reaches 10 (the 4th Triangular number) it no longer increases on each turn, but players still restore their current Qubits on each turn.
* Roll to stay in Superposition (if applicable)
* Draw a Cloud tile and place it onto the battlefield. If all Cloud tiles have been drawn then move an unoccupied Cloud tile on the edge of the battlefield to another space on the map (can never cause the map to split into two different masses though)
* Draw a card from their Alters/Algorithms deck.
	* This step is skipped for the first turn of the game
	* If you ever need to draw a card and your Alters/Algorithms deck is empty then your Avatar loses three life instead.
* You may pay the cost in Qubits to flip your Avatar to its Superposition state (as long as you weren’t in Superposition during your last turn).
* _Battle Phase_: you may move and attack with all of your Alters/Avatars (see Battle Phase for further explanation)
* A player may play Alters from their hand by paying their cost in Qubits (Alters are summoned onto a Cloud tile of their type unless specified otherwise).
	* Note that this step is after the Battle Phase so any Alters that are summoned cannot move or attack until the following turn.
* Check win conditions (the opponent’s Avatar has been destroyed).
